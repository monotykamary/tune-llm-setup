# .tune Directory

This directory (`~/.tune`) serves as a global configuration and workspace for the associated VSCode extension.

The primary purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized location for:

- **Global settings:** Configure the behavior of the VSCode extension across all your projects.
- **Shared resources:** Store files, scripts, or other assets that can be accessed by the extension.
- **Customizations:** Define custom configurations or extensions for the tool's functionality.

By setting the VSCode extension to point to this directory, you establish a consistent and personalized environment for your development workflow.
